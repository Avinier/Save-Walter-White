          My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br />
          found out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to
          happen<br />
          soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about a
          lot of stuff.<br />
          Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I
          kind<br />
          of took him for granted or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents
          are<br />
          just always there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging
          you<br />
          to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br />
          try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br />
          day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br />
          "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br />
          crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's
          different since<br />
          Dad got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in
          the<br />
          near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.
        </p>
        <p class="font-body text-secondary text-center text-2xl pb-10">
          Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate
          that<br />
          question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being
          respon-<br />
          sible. One day he won't be here to
          ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I feel lucky when I hear<br />
          his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear
          him cough-<br />
          ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.

          My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly
          smart.<br />
          I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the most random
          stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like<br />
          how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid
          form.<br />
          And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's
          frozen it<br />
          takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you slowly pour a
          handful of salt<br />
          into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the
          water level<br />
          will go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about
          everything. He<br />
          doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into
          chemistry.<br />
          I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody
          is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook<br />
          because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says
          chemi-<br />
          cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always
          explaining as he<br />
          goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good
          teacher.<br />
          He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.
        </p>
        <p class="font-body text-stone-50 text-center text-xl pb-10">
          The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always
          had to<br />
          hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br />
          (Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally
          loser<br />
          shoes he always wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on
          my nerves.<br />
          Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with
          teachers.<br />
          The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he
          does,<br />
          and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack.
          That's<br />
          how he is at home and at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out
          what a good qual-<br />
          ity that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and
          what<br />
          made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted to
          be or not.<br />
          Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but
          because of<br />
          my dad being a teacher there I was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two
          things now.<br />
          First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done
          deal.<br />
          And two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of
          physical stuff be-<br />
          cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be
          with a<br />
          lot of other dads I've met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because
          they're into<br />
          sports or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a
          disability but you sure<br />
          wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get
          along. It<br />
          makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't
          care<br />
          about what the kids at school say anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line
          is he's a good<br />
          teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know
          he<br />
          cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is
          what he loves the <br />
          best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what
          he loves to do<br />
          for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and
          my family.

        It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got
        cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not<br />
        that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as
        that,<br />
        but it was sure a bad time for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom was pregnant with
        what she calls<br />
        a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby
        she's<br />
        actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help
        pay<br />
        all the regular bills. And that was before he got his
        diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't<br />
        have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical
        bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;And<br />
        my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take
        char-<br />
        ity.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I'm doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because I want
        to make him mad or<br />
        upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-stone-50 text-center text-xl pb-10">
        One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more
        than a<br />
        regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones)
        don't<br />
        take insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, one
        of the big reasons why<br />
        my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was
        because he<br />
        didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about
        my<br />
        dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
        we want him<br />
        around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long
        as<br />
        possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his
        life.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we<br />
        can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have
        with<br />
        him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my
        dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to<br />
        know him for herself.
